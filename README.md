Usage

1. This app is free to use while it is in the development phase.
2. Since, the app is not yet used for commercial purposes, the user can input songs by himself.
3. The app creates a karaoke of the song the user uploads. (There is a limit to the length of the song for now which is 1 minute and the only formats allowed are mp3 and wav. Also the quality of the karaoke can be controlled based on the requirements.)
4. Since the generation of karaoke requires heavy processing, we request the user to revisit us after he gets an email from us about the successful karaoke generation.
5. If the user inputs a song whose karaoke is already generated, he gets the email instantly( handled via hashing).
6. The user is then required to click on the link in the email and input his credentials and proceed to the singing page.
7. The singing page has a calibration tool embedded(called Rms) for calibrating the userâ€™s microphone and also the noise control for the song(This step is crucial since microphone thresholds vary from device to device. Also the noise levels depend upon the type of song the user inputs).
8. On the singing page the karaoke starts to play after 5 seconds so the user is expected to grant the microphone access as prompted on the page in time.
9. The user is then required to sing along with the karaoke (using headphones so that we can clearly evaluate). The user can see his pitch plot and karaoke's pitch plot in real time.
10. The user can try singing multiple times simply by reloading the page singing page.
11. After the user is satisfied and presses the "proceed" button, he is redirected to the leaderboard page where he can see his scores along with the scores of people who sang the same songs as he did as well as his score history.
